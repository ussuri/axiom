# Axiom: Universal File System, Streams, and Processes API for JS

Axiom is a cross browser library that provides primitives for File Systems, Streams, and Processes.

Axiom is not a "framework" or a "toolkit".  You do not have to redesign your application to use Axiom.  Axiom doesn't mind if you're already using other JavaScript libraries.  Axiom's main goal in life is to a buffer between your application and stuff that fits into its file system view of the world.

## File Systems

As a JavaScript developer you have a few options when it comes to file systems.

On the client side, you might roll your your own Indexed DB based file system.  If you can afford to choose one browser, you might use Chrome's DOM File System API.  Or maybe you have really simple needs and can lean on window.localStorage.

If you need cloud based storage, you'll probably depend on one or more web APIs from Google, Microsoft, DropBox, Box.net, or others.

If you've got more specialized needs, maybe you're trying to build a local [editor](https://atom.io/) or [cloud IDE](https://c9.io/), you might write a native app that embeds a browser or cook up your own remote file system protocol.

The situation can be crudely summarized with this diagram:

Every file system comes with its own API.  Most are drastically different from each other.  In the custom solution case, you're completely on your own.

Axiom adds a normalization layer to this story.

The Axiom library works in modern web browsers *and* node.js, meaning that your file system code can be much more portable.

Clients that depend on Axiom conduct all file system access through the Axiom API.  File System drivers provided by third parties handle the access to and from the underlying storage.

Clients with special needs can provide their own file system drivers.  As a bonus, most custom solutions can be solved with just a new transport layer (a way for the browser to speak to your custom storage back end).

## Processes and Streams

The Axiom file system API also covers processes and streams.

Process support means that clients can invoke any path that is marked as executable.  When this happens, a callback registered when the file was created will be invoked.  The callback will receive arguments provided by the caller, along with stdin, stdout, and stderr streams and an event stream for out-of-band signaling.  The callback can execute asynchronously, and exit with an 'ok' or 'error' disposition and a result value.

This provides great freedom in decoupling caller and callee.  The conventions around passing arguments and communicating are well defined and flexible enough to cover a large number of situations.  It's also inherently "remotable", meaning that you can write a general proxy which forwards calls to another origin, or across the network.

As an example, we've already used this to create a "pnacl" command which can load and arbitrary [pnacl](https://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl) port from the network (such as vim or python) and run it from with our [web_shell](../samples/web_shell) sample application.  The same approach could work for asm.js, or "virtual" executables hosted by a cloud service.
